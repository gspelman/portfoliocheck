<p>My background is in Communication, Graphic Design, and Technical Recruitment. 
			Currently, I'm a Graduate student at the University of Michigan School of Information with a specialization in UX design. 
			Through my experience I've developed a strong background in research, conducting interviews, communication, and understanding design principles. <br>
	 
<br> I was driven into design because I felt it balanced my innate creative sense, analytical desire of organization, and love of research. 
	  Additionally, design boasts the reward of solving problems while making a difference in people's lives.
